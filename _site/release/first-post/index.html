<p>Hey! After many months of hard work by Jekyll’s contributors, we’re excited
to announce the first major release of the project in a long while. v1.0.0 is
finally here! While the list of improvements and bug fixes is <a href="/docs/history/#v1-0-0">quite lengthy</a>,
here are the highlights (thanks to <a href="http://twitter.com/BenBalter">@benbalter</a> for the
examples and for compiling this list):</p>

<ul>
  <li>Support for the Gist tag for easily embedding Gists (<a href="https://gist.github.com/benbalter/5555251">example</a>)</li>
  <li>Automatically generated post excerpts (<a href="https://gist.github.com/benbalter/5555369">example</a>)</li>
  <li>Save and preview drafts before publishing (<a href="https://gist.github.com/benbalter/5555992">example</a>)</li>
</ul>

<p>Take a look at the <a href="/docs/upgrading/">Upgrading</a> page in the docs for more detailed information.</p>
